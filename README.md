# Master-Thesis
Contains the data and the code to the project of my master thesis. My master thesis project was performed in the cEVO group of Prof. Dr. Stadler and in the Seminar for Statistics at ETHZ in Spring 2024 during my master studies of mathematics at ETHZ, under the supervision of Dr. James D. Munday, Prof. Dr. Nicolai Meinshausen and Prof. Dr. Tanja Stadler. 

## Abstract
Accurately monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in a population and detecting the emergence of potentially
dangerous new variants though sequencing are crucial for public health surveillance. This master
thesis investigates the impact of storage duration of wastewater samples on the quality of SARS-
CoV-2 sequences and, more precisely, its impact on amplicon dropouts. Identifying any significant
effect is vital for ensuring precise and reliable pathogen monitoring. Two metrics were defined to
assess the quality of sequences: entropy and coverage. Data from various wastewater treatment
plants, during both high and low concentration periods, were analysed using regression models. The
study revealed that while delays showed some effect in high concentration periods, this effect was not
significant in low concentration periods, where concentration impacted the metrics more significantly.
These findings suggest that while the sequencing process is generally robust against delays, a drop
in concentration below a certain threshold can affect results.

## Content
This repository contains two jupyter notebooks. One with the analysis of the data from low concentration periods in 2021, the other with the analysis of the data from the high concentration periods in 2022/23.
